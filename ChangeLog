0.3.0
* oz:
  * more C++11 features
    * move semantics
    * defaulted & deleted functions
    * constexpr for float constants
    * iterators support range-for (however, foreach macro is still used because of faulty IDE
      parsers and better performance in debug mode)
  * better Win32 support, POSIX API replaced with Win32 API where possible
  * System.bell() method
  * String class has more consistent members, parsing functions added
  * new Time class
  * new StackTrace class
  * OutputStream is readable
  * new BufferStream class (OutputStream with dynamic internal storage)
  * new PhysFile class, version of File class for PhysicsFS
  * Vec3, Vec4, Quat don't inherit from each other or Simd class
  * AABB & Bounds moved to liboz from matrix
  * compiled as shared library
  * additional dependencies; libpulse on Linux and PhysicsFS 2.0
  * fully documented
  * X11 licence for liboz
* common:
  * new layer, split from matrix
  * Span and Timer classes moved to common from matrix
  * new Lingua class, gettext-like system, but modularised and suitable for data package system
* matrix:
  * object attributes, tell what special abilities an object can have (nigh vision, satnav, music
    player)
  * keys; object can have assigned a key value, so it can lock/unlock matching structure entities
  * lava, can be used in both structures and instead of sea in terrain
  * sliding damage
  * configurable gravity acceleration
  * structure improvements
    * crushing - structures fall into terrain, and crush objects in their way
    * bound objects - objects that are created together with a structure and destroyed with it;
      useful for defence turrets
    * air brushes to tag certain structure areas that should not be filled with water when a
      structure is under sea
    * no more need for hull around BSPs
    * triggers - some entities can be used, upon usage trigger themselves or other entities
    * entities can be locked/unlocked with appropriate key
    * manual door
    * elevators
    * if an entity moves to a side, it also moves objects that lay on it - like stacks of objects
  * fragment pools - particle replacements; fragments can be configured like object classes, can
    have a graphic model assigned, etc.
  * BSPs, object classes and fragment pools are internally referenced by BSP/ObjectClass/FragPool
    pointer instead by strings
* client:
  * specular and emission masks - specular lighting is done per-pixel, objects can emit light
  * offscreen rendering support
  * postprocessing, bloom postprocess effect
  * Sound class
    * sounds are played asynchronously parallel to rendering
    * asynchronous streaming of tracks
    * support for music in MP3 and AAC formats
    * user-specified directory can be searched for music
* build:
  * prebuilding entirely split from the runtime part of the engine
  * SDL_image replaced by FreeImage, wider range of image formats supported for prebuilding source
  * 16-bit colours for terrain heightmap
* tools:
  * ozFormat tool for formatting object class files
* general:
  * PhysicsFS used for accessing game data, so they can be loaded directly from archives
  * game data can be modularised into packages
  * Lua classes share API code - no more code triplication for Lua APIs
