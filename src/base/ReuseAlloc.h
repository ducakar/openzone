 *
 *  Reuse allocator base class
 *  Base class for memory reusing. All classes which inherit from ReuseAlloc will have overloaded
 *  new and delete operators. The new operator will try to reuse memory from deleted objects form
 *  that class. At least the end of the program you should call Class::deallocate() for all
 *  ReuseAlloc-derived classes. Performance can increase up to 100%.
