/*
 *  Synapse.h
 *
 *  World actions cheduler.
 *    World should not be touched directly for adding/removing objects. Because objects may have
 *  hold references to each other (by indices), after object removal a full world update must pass,
 *  so that all references to the removed object are cleared. (On each update every reference must
 *  be checked. If it points to a null object slot, the target object has been removed. On order for
 *  this to work, a full world update must pass before another objects occupies freed slot,
 *  the reference may point to a new object, that may be of a different type that may result in a
 *  program crash or at least a real mess.)
 *    The second reason is that world update may be multithreaded and adding an object in the middle
 *  of an update may put it in a sector that is handled by some other thread, which may result in
 *  a nasty-and-hard-to-discover-and-hard-to-squash bug.
 *    The third reason is networking. In this mode client should not add/remove objects and similar
 *  mechanism to deliver object additions/removals would be needed anyway.
 *    For obvious reasons (networking support and the first reason), use and take interactions are
 *  exploiting this mechanism as well.
 *    The world object should process synapse before world update in the matrix.
