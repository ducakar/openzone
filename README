Troubleshooting
---------------
- Make sure you have the *LATEST* display drivers.
- Turning off desktop effects on Linux may significantly improve performance.
- You need at least OpenGL 2.1 compatible graphic card & driver with support of
  the following extensions:
  - GL_ARB_framebuffer_object and
  - GL_EXT_texture_compression_s3tc.
  Cards with complete DirectX 9.0c support should do. On Linux, the engine works
  with both properitary and opensource Gallium3D drivers.
- If you are using Gallium3D-based drivers and textures are (mostly) missing,
  set shader.setSamplerIndices to "false" in <config>/client.rc file.
- If you are using AMD/ATI Catalyst driver and terrain looks white/grey, set
  shader.setSamplerIndices to "true" in <config>/client.rc file.
- If you are using some old graphics card or AMD/ATI Catalyst drivers and MD2
  models are missing set shader.vertexTexture to "false" in <config>/client.rc
  file. Otherwise set it to "true" for better rendering performance.

Dependencies
------------
Binary packages already either include all required libraries or list them as
dependencies.

The following libraries are required in run-time:
- libpulse
- PhysicsFS
- SDL
- Lua
- OpenGL
- OpenAL
- FreeImage (optional, for ozBuild tool)
- libvorbis
- libmad (optional, to play MP3 files)
- faad2 (optional, to play AAC files).

Command line
------------
openzone [-v] [-l | -i <mission>] [-t <num>] [-p <prefix>]

  -v
        More verbose log output.

  -l
        Skip main menu and load the last autosaved state.

  -i <mission>
        Skip main menu and start mission <mission>.
        Missions reside in <prefix>/share/openzone/lua/mission.

  -t <num>
        Exit after <num> seconds (can be a floating-point number) and use 42 as
        the random seed. Useful for benchmarking.

  -p <prefix>
        Sets data directory to <prefix>/share/openzone.
        Default: '/usr'.

Settings
--------
Settings file is located in "$HOME/.config/openzone/client.rc" on Linux-like
systems or in "%APPDATA%\openzone\client.rc" on Windows. Assuming default setup
that is:
- Linux: /home/<user>/.config/openzone/client.rc
- WinXP: C:\Documents and Settings\<user>\Application Data\openzone\client.rc
- Win7:  C:\Users\<user>\AppData\Roaming\openzone\client.rc

variable [type] default_value
-----------------------------
_version [string] "0.3.0"
  Version of OpenZone for which the settings file was created. If version
  doesn't match, OpenZone saves updated configuration on exit. Obsolete
  variables are lost during that process.

camera.angle [float] 80.0
  Vertical camera angle in degrees. Horizontal angle adjusted depending on
  aspect ratio.

camera.aspect [float] 0.0
  Aspect ratio (width/height). If 0.0, it is determined from the screen
  resolution.

camera.keysXSens [float] 1.0
  Key sensitivity for left/right arrow keys.

camera.keysYSens [float] 1.0
  Key sensitivity for up/down arrow keys.

camera.mouseXSens [float] 1.0
  Horizontal mouse sensitivity.

camera.mouseYSens [float] 1.0
  Vertical mouse sensitivity.

dir.music [string] ""
  Top directory that will be recursively searched for *.oga, *.ogg, *.mp3 and
  *.aac files. All found tracks will be accessible from Music Player along the
  original tracks included in game data.

dir.prefix [string] Linux: "/usr", Windows: "."
  Prefix path to game directory structure. The share/openzone directory should
  be located inside the prefix directory.

lingua [string] ""
  Language code for translations. Language code must correspond to a
  subdirectory of "lingua" directory in one of game data archives.

mouse.accelFactor [float] 0.04
  Usually OS applies mouse acceleration before OpenZone reads the mouse input.
  The only exception is when running in fullscreen mode on X11 server. In this
  case OpenZone tries to emulate X11 mouse acceleration.

profile.playerName [string] "<user>"
  Name of the player. Capitalised username of the current user by default.

  render.deferred [bool] false
  Enable deferred shading. Not really implemented yet.
  This option has effect only if offscreen rendering is enabled.

render.lowDetail [bool] false
  Use simpler lighting (no specular lighting and emission) and disable stars
  to increase rendering performance.

render.offscreen [bool] true
  Enable rendering into offscreen buffers instead directly to the screen. This
  enables some advanced effects like deferred shading and postprocessing. It
  also enables that the world is rendered at resolution that differ from the
  screen resolution.

render.offscreenFilte [NEAREST|LINEAR] LINEAR
  Which texture filter to use when rendering content of the offscreen buffer to
  the screen. Can be LINEAR to interpolate between pixels (smooth, blurry image)
  or NEAREST to select nearest pixel value (blocky image).
  It has no effect if offscreen buffer resolution is the same as screen
  resolution. Usually one would prefer LINEAR unless screen resolution is a
  multiple of offscreen buffer resolution (in other words 1.0 / render.scale is
  an integer).

render.postprocess [bool] true
  Enable postprocessing when using offscreen rendering.

render.scale [float] 1.0
  Scale of resolution of offscreen buffer where world is rendered to.

render.showAim [bool] false
  Draw a small green box at the point you are currenty aiming at. It was
  intended for testing collision detection.

render.showBounds [bool] false
  Show AABBs of objects. Green for solid objects, grey for non-solid objects,
  blue for structures and red for structure entities.

render.visibilityRange [float] 300.0
  Visible range.

screen.full [bool] false
  Start in fullscreen mode.

screen.height [int] 0
  Vertical screen resolution. Zero equals desktop resolution.

screen.vsync [bool] true
  Try to turn on vertical synchronisation.

screen.width [int] 0
  Horizontal screen resolution. Zero equals desktop resolution.

seed [int | string] "TIME"
  Seed for random number generator. Can be an integer or "TIME" to use the
  current time as the seed.

shader.setSamplerIndices [bool] false
  Set indices for texture samplers. If set, breaks textures on Gallium3D driver.
  If not set, breaks textures on older ATI/AMD Catalyst drivers.

shader.vertexTexture [bool] false
  Use vertex texture fetch feature to perform mesh animation in vertex shader.
  Should work on GeForce 6 or newer and Radeon HD 2xxx or newer. Does not work
  with Catalyst drivers.

sound.device [string] ""
  Sound device to pass to OpenAL. If empty string, choice is left to OpenAL.
  To see available devices look into log file <config>/client.log.

sound.volume [float] 1.0
  Sound volume. 1.0 means full (original) intensity.

ui.aspect [float] 0.0
  Aspect ratio for UI. If 0.0, it is determined from screen resolution.

ui.scale [float] 1.0
  Scale for UI resolution.

ui.showBuild [bool] false
  Show a windows with buttons to add various objects into the world. For
  development purpuses.

ui.showDebug [bool] false
  Show a window that shows coordinates, orientation and other data about camera,
  controlled bot, tagged object etc. For development purposes.

ui.showFPS
  Show frames per second. Since world simulation runs on 60 Hz FPS cannot be
  higher than this value.
