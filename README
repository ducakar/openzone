Command line
------------
openzone [--help] [(--load | -l) | (--init | -i) <function>]
         [(--time | -t) <num>] [(--prefix | -p) <prefix>]

--help
      Prints that help message.

-l, --load
      Skip main menu and load autosaved state.
      Autosaved game state resides in ~/.config/openzone/autosave.ozState.

-i <mission>, --init <mission>
      Skip main menu and start mission <mission>.
      Missions reside in <prefix>/share/openzone/lua/mission in files named
      <mission>.lua files.

-t <num>, --time <num>
      Exits after <num> seconds (can be a floating-point number).
      For benchmarking purposes.

-p <prefix>, --prefix <prefix>
      Sets data directory to <prefix>/share/openzone and locale directory to
      <prefix>/share/locale.
      Default: '/usr/local'.

Notes
-----
- On first run ~/.config/openzone/client.rc (on Windows: %APPDATA%\OpenZone\client.rc) configuration
  file with default settings is generated. Edit it to change any settings you wish.
- %APPDATA% usually means 'C:\Documents and Settings\username\Application Data' on Windows XP or
  C:\Users\username\AppData\Roaming on Windows 7.

Troubleshooting
---------------
- Make sure you have the *LATEST* display drivers.
- Turning off desktop effects on Linux may improve performance when running in windowed mode.
- You need at least OpenGL 2.1 compatible graphic card & driver that additionally supports the
  following extensions:
  - GL_ARB_framebuffer_object and
  - GL_EXT_texture_compression_s3tc.
  A cards with complete DirectX 9.0c support should do, a DirectX 10 card will certainly do.
  On Linux the engine works both with properitary and opensource Gallium3D drivers.
- If you are using Gallium3D based drivers and all textures are (mostly) missing, set
  shader.setSamplerIndices to "false" in client.rc file.
- If you are using AMD/ATI Catalyst driver and terrain looks white/grey, set
  shader.setSamplerIndices to "true" in client.rc file.
- If you are using some old graphics card or AMD/ATI Catalyst drivers and MD2 models are missing
  set shader.vertexTexture to "false" in client.rc file.
- For better performance you can enable MD2 animation to be performed in the vertex shader by
  setting shader.vertexTexture to "true" in client.rc file.

Dependencies
------------
- pthreads (already included in glibc on Linux)
- libintl (already included in glibc on Linux)
- SDL
- SDL_image (optional, for ozPrebuild tool, must support at least PNG and JPEG)
- SDL_ttf
- OpenGL
- OpenAL
- libvorbis
- Lua

On Linux you have to install packages that provide those libraries.
For Windows build, all dependencies are included.

Build dependencies
------------------
- basic GNU system (bash, coreutils, grep, sed ...)
- gettext
- cmake
- GNU make
- GNU binutils
- GCC >= 4.6 or LLVM/Clang >= 3.0
- development packages of libraries from previous section
