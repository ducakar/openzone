AI behaviours
-------------
beastie (beast)
- Just randomly run and jump aroud.
prey (goblin)
- Run away from everyone but another goblin.
predator (knight)
- Search for goblins and run into them.
droid (droid)
- If you see anything but another droid or droid commander, hunt it.
- If there's no target, follow droid commander if any nearby, otherwise walk around and search for
  a target.

Tips
----
- You can jump to a little higher places if you crouch and uncrouch during jump.
- To equip/unequip a weapon right click it in your inventory.
- To lift an object, your hands must be empty (no weapon equipped), you must not be swimming and
  object must not be too heavy. If you don't stand close enough to the object it may slip from your
  hands immediately after you grab it. It may also slip from your hands if it is hit by another
  object form above.
- To climb the ladder look up or down into a ladder. If you move away from the ladder you will
  fall from it.
- You can move faster under water if you walk on the bottom. Just move into the bottom to do it.
- When a vehicle is destroyed, it automatically ejects the pilot.
- To see some fun, spawn a droid (not droid commander) form the build menu.
- To see some more fun, put the droid into a tank. (Just incarnate into the droid, embark the tank
  and deincarnate. The AI will take over the droid and perform some rampage.)

Command line
------------
openzone [OPTIONS]

--help
      Prints that help message.

--load, --no-load
-l, -L
      Enables or disables autoload of ~/.openzone/default.ozState on startup respectively.
      Overrides the 'autoload' resource.

--save, --no-save
-s, -S
      Enables or disables autosave to ~/.openzone/default.ozState on exit respectively.
      Overrides the 'autosave' resource.

--time num
-t num
      Exits after num seconds (can be a floating-point number). For benchmarking purposes.

Notes
-----
- On first run ~/.config/openzone/client.rc (on Windows: %APPDATA%\OpenZone\client.rc) configuration
  file with default settings is generated. Edit it to change any settings you wish.
- %APPDATA% usually means C:\Documents and Settings\username\Application Data on Windows XP or
  C:\Users\username\AppData\Roaming on Windows 7

Troubleshooting
---------------
- Make sure you have the *LATEST* display drivers.
- You need at least OpenGL 2.1 compatible graphic card & driver that additionally supports the
  following features:
  - vertex array object (GL_ARB_vertex_array_object),
  - framebuffer object (GL_ARB_framebuffer_object),
  - textures that contain data in floating-point format (GL_ARB_texture_float),
  - S3 DXT1 and DXT5 texture compression (GL_EXT_texture_compression_s3tc),
  - GLSL 1.30 shading language and
  - vertex texture fetch (optional).
  A card with a complete DirectX 9.0c support should do.

Dependencies
------------
- SDL
- SDL_image (needed for prebuild only, needs at least PNG and JPEG support)
- SDL_ttf
- SDL_net (optional)
- OpenGL (MesaGL headers)
- OpenAL
- FreeALUT
- libvorbis
- Lua

On Linux you have to install packages that provide those libraries.
For Windows build, all dependencies are included.
