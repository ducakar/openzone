AI behaviours
-------------
beastie (beast)
- Just randomly run and jump aroud.
prey (goblin)
- Run away from everyone but another goblin.
predator (knight)
- Search for goblins and run into them.
droid (droid)
- If you see anything but another droid or droid commander, hunt it.
- If there's no target, follow droid commander if any nearby, otherwise walk around and search for
  a target.

Tips
----
- You can jump to a little higher places if you crouch and uncrouch during jump.
- To lift object, your hands must be empty (no weapon equipped), you must not be swimming and
  object must not be too heavy. If you don't stand close enough to the object it may slip from your
  hands immediately after you grab it.
- To equip/unequip a weapon right click it in your inventory.
- To climb the ladder look up or down into a ladder. If you move away from the ladder you will
  fall from it.
- You can move faster under water if you walk on the bottom. Just move into the bottom to do it.
- To see some fun, spawn a droid (not droid commander) form the build menu.
- To see some more fun, put the droid into a tank. (Just incarnate into the droid, embark the tank
  and deincarnate. The AI will take over the droid and perform some rampage.)
