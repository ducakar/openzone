AI behaviours
-------------
beastie (beast)
- Just randomly run and jump around.
prey (goblin)
- Run away from everyone but another goblin.
predator (knight)
- Search for goblins and run into them.
droid (droid)
- If you see anything but another droid or droid commander, hunt and shoot it.
- If there's no target, follow droid commander if any nearby, otherwise walk around and search for
  a target.

Tips
----
- You can jump to a little higher places if you crouch and uncrouch during jump.
- To equip/unequip a weapon right click it in your inventory.
- To lift an object, your hands must be empty (no weapon equipped), you must not be swimming and
  object must not be too heavy. If you don't stand close enough to the object it may slip from your
  hands immediately after you grab it. It may also slip from your hands if it is hit by another
  object form above.
- To climb the ladder look up or down into a ladder. If you move away from the ladder you will
  fall from it.
- You can move faster under water if you walk on the bottom. Just move into the bottom to do it.
- You can run only if you are not crouched and you are not holding an object.
- When a vehicle is destroyed, it automatically ejects the pilot.
- To see some fun, spawn a droid (not droid commander) form the build menu.
- To see some more fun, put the droid into a tank. (Just incarnate into the droid, embark the tank
  and deincarnate. The AI will take over the droid and perform some rampage.)

Command line
------------
openzone [--help] [--load | -l | --no-load | -L]
         [--save | -s | --no-save | -S] [(--time | -t) <num>]
         [(--prefix | -p) <prefix>]

--help
      Prints that help message.

-l, --load
-L, --no-load
      Enables or disables autoload of ~/.config/openzone/default.ozState on
      startup respectively. Overrides the 'autoload' resource.

-s, --save
-S, --no-save
      Enables or disables autosave to ~/.config/openzone/default.ozState on exit
      respectively. Overrides the 'autosave' resource.

-t <num>, --time <num>
      Exits after <num> seconds (can be a floating-point number).
      For benchmarking purposes.

-p <prefix>, --prefix <prefix>
      Sets data directory to <prefix>/share/openzone and locale directory to
      <prefix>/share/locale.

Notes
-----
- On first run ~/.config/openzone/client.rc (on Windows: %APPDATA%\OpenZone\client.rc) configuration
  file with default settings is generated. Edit it to change any settings you wish.
- %APPDATA% usually means C:\Documents and Settings\username\Application Data on Windows XP or
  C:\Users\username\AppData\Roaming on Windows 7.

Troubleshooting
---------------
- Make sure you have the *LATEST* display drivers.
- You need at least OpenGL 2.1 compatible graphic card & driver that additionally supports the
  following extensions:
  - GL_ARB_framebuffer_object.
  A cards with complete DirectX 9.0c support should do, a DirectX 10 card will certainly do.
  On Linux the engine works both with properitary and opensource Gallium3D drivers.
- If you are using Gallium3D based drivers and all textures are (mostly) missing, set
  shader.setSamplerIndices to "false" in client.rc file.
- If you are using AMD/ATI Catalyst driver and terrain looks white/grey, set
  shader.setSamplerIndices to "true" in client.rc file.
- If you are using some old graphics card or AMD/ATI Catalyst drivers and MD2 models are missing
  set shader.vertexTexture to "false" in client.rc file.
- For better performance you can enable MD2 animation to be performed in the vertex shader by
  setting shader.vertexTexture to "true" in client.rc file.

Dependencies
------------
- pthreads (already included in glibc on Linux)
- libintl (already included in glibc on Linux)
- SDL
- SDL_image (optional, for ozPrebuild tool, must support at least PNG and JPEG)
- SDL_ttf
- SDL_net (optional, for multiplayer -- which does not work yet)
- OpenGL
- OpenAL
- libvorbis
- Lua

On Linux you have to install packages that provide those libraries.
For Windows build, all dependencies are included.

Build dependencies
------------------
- basic GNU system (bash, coreutils, grep, sed ...)
- cmake
- GNU make
- GNU binutils
- GCC >= 4.5 or LLVM/Clang >= 2.9
- gettext
- development packages of libraries from previous section
