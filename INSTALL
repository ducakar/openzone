Prerequisites:
--------------
- GNU tools (GCC, GNU Make, GNU Binutils)
- CMake
- LibXml2
- Lua
- SDL
- SDL_image
- SDL_ttf
- SDL_net
- OpenGL (MesaGL recommended, usually included in X11 + graphics driver)
- OpenGL GLU (MesaGLU recommended, usually included in X11)
- OpenAL (AL Soft recommended)
- ALUT (FreeALUT recommended)

Quick build instructions:
-------------------------
./autogen.sh
cmake .
make -j2

More detailed build instructions:
---------------------------------
1. run "./autogen.sh" to generate src/*/CMakeLists.txt
2. configure project running "cmake-gui ." for Qt interface or "ccmake ." for ncurses interface.
   It's also possible to do it in command line with cmake and various switches, but highly unpractical,
   unless you're writing a script.
3. run "make -j42" if you have a 42-core cpu, to run make in 42 parallel proccesses.

Data
----
Uncompress data in to /some/dir/data and set that path in ~/.openzone/client.xml if /some/dir/ != /usr/share/
The sample client.xml is located in the project's root dir.
