    * ZLIB licence
- common
    * new layer, split from matrix
    * Span and Timer classes moved to common from matrix
    * new Lingua class, gettext-like system, but modularised and suitable for data package system
- matrix
    * BSPs, object classes, fragment pools, client imagos and audios are internally referenced by
      pointers or indices instead by strings, several lookup hashtables replaced by arrays
    * object attributes: tell what special abilities an object can have (nigh vision, binoculars,
      satnav, music player ...)
    * fragment pools: particle replacements; fragments can be configured like object classes, can
      have a graphic model assigned, etc.
    * keys: object can have assigned a key value, so it can lock/unlock matching structure entities
    * lava: can be used both in structures and terrain instead of sea
    * objects can be rotated around z axis in 90Â° steps

          useful for defence turrets

          structure is under sea
        + sea brushes tag areas with the same content as terrain sea (including fog colour)

- client
    * smooth loading: model loading split to preloading (mapping file to memory) that is run in a
      new thread and upload to graphic card that has to be synchronous with rendering

      masks) and normal map
    * objects are filtered from rendering if aspect angle from eye is too small
    * configurable fog colour for both terrain and structure water/lava
    * Mesh class
        + meshes are not rendered immediately but lists are created for each mesh and all instances
          of a mesh are rendered together
        + MD2-like vertex animation integrated into Mesh class

        + key-to-action mappings, key/mouse sensitivity etc.
        + input.json configuration file
    * resizable main window
    * new main menu, mission selection menu
