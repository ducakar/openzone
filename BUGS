Xorg 1.12 issues:
- Mouse wheel moves are sometime not detected or wheel moves that didn't happen are detected when
  wheel changes direction. It seems it's a bug in Xinput 1.6 as many other applications also have
  similar issues. AFAIK workaround for this bug is not possible.
- Mesa 8.0 doesn't generate mipmaps correctly (higher levels are black) when using S3 texture
  compression.
