- MD2 animation issues: strange run animation on suboptimal frame rates, gestures are not played
  completely, death loops ...
- External camera rotation for vehicle is not sync'ed with bot (because relative to vehicle).
- MD3 builder uses some uninitialised data, sometimes generates broken models.
- NaCl port doesn't render anything.
- When building textures with Mesa 8.0.0 through 8.0.2 and S3 texture compression turned on, mipmaps
  are not generated correctly (higher levels are black).
